Afaik they secured 367 pretty well so there is no sollution to gain access ATM. But there are no new features in comparison to 352, afaik. Just stay on 352!

### Forever-Young 2021-09-18T15:15:07Z
I'll try with 70.00.352B.

Meanwhile, I unzipped several versions I have.

56.00.513B, 70.00.352B, 70.00.367A - all those have a step `passwdupdate` with the logic:

70x
```
# passwd needs updating everytime
cp /tmp/passwd /tmp/configtmp/passwd
```

but 56x:
```
if grep '^root:' /config-mfg/passwd ; then
    # passwd needs updating
    cp /tmp/passwd /tmp/configtmp/passwd
```

version 55x didn't have `passwdupdate` (at least NA one, I don't have EU 55x)

56x has `cmu` and `user` in passwd file (which is being copied during the install)

70x only has `cmu` user

`cmu` hashes are all the same (56/70)

`user` hash is much simpler, without the salt part, so I guess it's the `jci` one.

Today, before the update (being on 56), I could log in as `user`, and `root` with pw `jci`, didn't try the `cmu` user.

I guess we could "lost" the password for `root` even before 70, but password updating script was faulty.

Also, 70x updates has `neutralizeid7` script:

```
LAST_MESSAGE='"ID7_Recovery_Scripts" is not found.'
TARGET_DIR="/mnt/data_persist/dev/bin"
CONF_FILE="autorun"

if [ -e "${TARGET_DIR}/${CONF_FILE}" ]; then
    echo '"ID7_Recovery_Scripts" is found, so that getting them disabled...'
    LAST_MESSAGE="completed."
fi

if [ -d ${TARGET_DIR} ] ; then
    cd ${TARGET_DIR}
    ${DEBUG} rm -rf 00-*
    ${DEBUG} rm -rf 01-*
    ${DEBUG} rm -f adb
    ${DEBUG} rm -f 99-*.autorun
    ${DEBUG} rm -f ${CONF_FILE}
fi

echo ${LAST_MESSAGE}
echo ls -al ${TARGET_DIR} ; ls -al ${TARGET_DIR}

exit 0
```

Regarding the ability to run commands during the update (I'm not sure if I would have it if I downgrade 367 -> 352), not sure where this is being specified (in install package).


### Forever-Young 2021-09-18T15:19:11Z
I started john the ripper on that `cmu` hash, not sure if it has any sense.

from the console

```
Loaded 1 password hash (sha256crypt, crypt(3) $5$ [SHA256 128/128 SSE4.1 4x])
...
0g 0:00:39:37  3/3 0g/s 995.1p/s 995.1c/s 995.1C/s dwars2
```

I guess it means 995 passwords per seconds? (on macbook)

GPU (on some big AWS server) I guess would help, but I'm not sure if I'm using john in the right way.

### Forever-Young 2021-09-18T16:07:35Z
Ah, and XX does password recovery (to `jci` I guess) among other things..

### Forever-Young 2021-09-18T16:22:23Z
Seeing neutralizeid7 script contents and contents of `/mnt/data_persist/dev/bin` (headunit, websocketd)

I have a question (for ID7 solution author?) - `autorun` is a required name?

Is it being run somewhere in the firmware by absolute path (`/dev/bin/autorun` or something)? If not, maybe moving to `sbin` would help).

Or hooking to those 2 binaries in `dev/bin` - replacing with a script, starting `autorun` (renamed) and then starting real binary.

### A-nglea 2021-10-07T11:18:17Z
I'm 75 and over the hill for developing but in my yoof it was common to gain unofficial access to Garmin Aviation Map updates. We used a hex editor to change a flag (licensed or not) and then needed to re-adjust the checksum value in the file header before saving..

It strikes me that we have password access to .up files and can decompress them. The 1.7Gb for a firmware update is just too large to get ones head around but what about the gracenote update files? They have permission to execute and if some extra payload was added to the gracenote.up - checksum recalculated and set - it might be possible to return a serial connection.

There is an execute.ini file that seem ripe for tampering:-
[Settings]

[Instructions]
Count = 4
1 = Execute,"echo ========== Start deleting Gracenote related files =========="
2 = Execute,"rm -rf /tmp/media.db"
3 = Execute,"rm -rf /data/media.db"
4 = Execute,"rm -rf /data/natp/persistence/usbaudio_*"

### Forever-Young 2021-10-07T11:28:11Z
@A-nglea but now it uses signatures to check the authenticity of the update..

### A-nglea 2021-10-07T11:47:10Z
Ok, I'll get my coat.

@bmos emailed to you

### acidicX 2021-11-13T16:26:50Z
Hi, I just tried to install it for the first time, seems I'm also on 70.00.367 EU already. Can't login.
@Forever-Young have you figured out a way to login?

Or is there a way to downgrade to 352B?

### Forever-Young 2021-11-13T16:33:37Z
@acidicX yeah, I just downgraded. I can email you the link

### acidicX 2021-11-13T16:39:17Z
Got it, thank you :)

### acidicX 2021-11-13T16:44:36Z
@Forever-Young do you maybe also have the manual on how to downgrade? Or is it just copy to a FAT32 USB drive and plug it in?

### Forever-Young 2021-11-13T17:12:33Z
The same manual as upgrade, do you have it?

@Forever-Young sadly not, no

### acidicX 2021-11-13T17:26:34Z
thanks again :)

### aholovan 2021-11-15T11:39:49Z
Hi gents! 
Do you think - is it possible to unpack the firmware, chroot into it, just set new password for cmu user and pack it again? And then go ahead with setup? 

### Forever-Young 2021-11-15T11:51:26Z
Updates are signed, so unless somebody would have a secret key to resign
it, no, it's not possible.
Or, patch the library that is doing the update to skip signature check..

### Nav1gatore 2021-11-21T16:55:33Z
Hi everyone,
I have made an update the CMU to 70.00.367 EU and also interested how to solve that issue mentioned above? 
The `user` and `cmu` doesn't work with the pswd `jci`. In this case, the only way is to be downgraded to firmware 70.00.352B.
So, if somebody has a link for the mentioned firmware and a checksum, let me know, please.
Thanks a lot in advance!

### Forever-Young 2021-11-21T17:28:30Z
@Nav1gatore send me an email

@Forever-Young just have sent

### Forever-Young 2021-11-28T05:40:36Z
Hmm, I didn't get anything around that time.

### Nav1gatore 2021-12-04T21:11:36Z
Ok, I managed to find one.
But I've got a trouble with install. So, need an advice how to resolve the "Install Not Successful". 
I started the downgrade from FW 70.00.367 to 70.00.352 and used the same instruction as for FW...367. When the update had almost been finished, at the point 99%, I got the screen with the message like that **Install Not Successful: System failure**.
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94797361/144724373-ebd25df0-81bc-47c0-a583-2be8968e3491.jpg)
![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94797361/144724382-b3762799-8b7d-401a-b57e-b3ee479b4334.jpg)

So, the system is trying to get a finish of the update process and doing that in a permanent cycle without success.
Also, I was connected through the serial port and used the putty's console. The log, attached bellow, has some errors like that
`Jan  1 00:00:20 reflash_app: [000.00:00:20.643624670], REFLASH, 230, reflash_app, 230, Warn, reflash_ul.c, REFLASH_UL_WriteLog 496, Failed to flush the reflash log file "/mnt/data_persist/reflash/reflash.log", error = 28 (No space left on device)!`
[putty_log.txt](https://github.com/Trevelopment/MZD-AIO/files/7654687/putty_log.txt)
Also, [a small video here about how it looks](https://youtu.be/uWHA0fHnTqc)
Has somebody an idea how to resolve that issue or might be smd had the similar problem and knows how to fix it?
Thanks to all in advance!

### Nav1gatore 2021-12-08T18:48:08Z
So, the issue is fixed.
If briefly, it was necessary to clear the **dumps** folder using the next command:
`# rm -rf ./tmp/mnt/data_persist/log/dumps/* ` 
and than the update/downgrade process had been continued. All in all, the CMU wrote the message "Version 70.00.352 software install was successful".

By the next step the ID7_Recovery_XX scripts had been installed 
`# cp -r /mnt/sd*/XX/* /mnt/data_persist/dev/bin/`
`# chmod +x /mnt/data_persist/dev/bin/autorun`
`# /mnt/data_persist/dev/bin/autorun`

So, the tweaks installs, the SSH works! The AndroidAuto (AA) is possible to install but it doesn't start after the connection of mobile. It's probably closed or well-secured for FW 70.00.XXX
If somebody knows how to lunch the AA using the mentioned FW, let me know, please.

### alexhermon 2022-07-25T19:25:10Z
@Nav1gatore - did you ever find a fix for getting AA on version 70.00.352 EU N ? Or any recommendations?

> @Nav1gatore - did you ever find a fix for getting AA on version 70.00.352 EU N ? Or any recommendations?

I tried to do that half year ago, but I didn't manage to find a fix for that time. So, probably, it could be available now.

### jwronken 2023-10-02T07:18:34Z
Hi, my car was delivered with .352 installed (2019 model), running the files in XX won't work unfortunately. 
Seems I need to downgrade (or better said, re-install) 70.00.352 EU version. However, I can't find this anywhere (the one's for sale are either .367 or the 74.xx versions). 
Does anyone have a backup?
Many thanks

### konwin 2023-10-08T14:01:07Z
@jwronken sent you an invite with a download link for 70.00.352 EU!

### jwronken 2023-10-08T14:20:01Z
@konwin many many thanks!!
Really appreciated 

### farghc 2024-04-05T12:09:37Z
Hi all, same problem here. I am on version .367 and need to downgrade to 70.00.352 EU version. Can anyone provide this version? Many thanks 

### alexhermon 2024-04-05T14:54:30Z
@farghc I bought the USB hub and didn't need to do the serial faff (Though installing the hub is still a bit of a faff...).
The description on this AliExpress post contains a link to download the firmware too, which I've used in the past:
https://a.aliexpress.com/_EJjvyOl

### farghc 2024-04-05T15:23:48Z
@alexhermon thank you very much. As i understand, i need to downgrade to 70.00.352 for using AIO Tweaks. The Version provided by AliExpress post (70.00.367) is already installed.

### Visnitz 2024-07-27T13:21:44Z
Can someone send me a 352 version compressed (shared password protected)? I can't find this version anywhere anymore.
